<h1>👋 Hi! Welcome to CodeXpired!</h6>
The CodeXpired organization was created by <a href="https://github.com/Gevionielly">Gevionielly<a> on <b>04.03.2023</b> <s>and is used as a warehouse of absolutely useless repositories written somehow</s>.

<h2>🐍 What we doin</h2>
The main goal of the organization was to "store" my repositories written in JavaScript, mineflayer, so as not to clutter up my main profile and just to have them in one place, yes, I'm a perfectionist. But taking into account the fact that this is an organization, my friends are members of this organization, so <b>anything can be here</b>.
